# CurvyPathGen
Language: Python  
Purpose: To generate a random curved path between the start and end points input by the user. Note that the user may also choose the type of curved path (i.e. cubic, with 2 turning points; quartic, with 3 turning points, etc.). The random curved path generator can be used in games when characters (i.e. objects for player to shoot) must move unpredictably between two points.
